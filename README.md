## Representation Across the Nation
**KPOP** : As someone who has been listening to kpop/korean music since they were in preschool I am so happy that it is getting the love and attention that it deserves. The production effort and training that producers/idols put into their music is very impressive. Not only this but I have always  admired how kpop and music has been a way for artists to break stereotypes and set new standars of beauty. When I was younger I remember never seeing asian representation and if asians were represented they were seen as nerds or losers. BTS and Blackpink are currently the biggest groups of KPOP, they have broken so many records. These two groups have recieved global recognition for their talents and are seen as role models for young impressionable teens. They spread awareness for mental health and self-love making sure that they set good examles for their young audience. As more music comes out I hope that these groups will continue to recieve lots of love and acceptance.

### **CINEMA**
I believe that Korea has amazing production and story telling skills. Koreans are known for their "dramatic" and "emotional" personalities and movies tend to involve many problems and relatable situations koreans deal with on a daily basis. Bong Joon Ho, the director of the academy award winning movie [Parasite](https://oscar.go.com/news/winners/parasite-wins-4-oscars-and-makes-oscar-history), has created many films involving social status, corruption in government, and true crime stories. He has already been recognized in Korea for making heart-warming films but I'm glad that he was the first korean director to ever get an oscar. Just knowing that a Korean movie was even nominated for an oscar makes me happy that language barriers doesn't take away meaning behind a film/story. It also makes me realize that the world is becoming more open to experiencing new cultures.

#### **OVERALL**
I never thought that my culture in particular would be loved in the way that it has. However, I have always tried to get to know the country that my family originates from. I am the only person in my family who was born in America which is why my parents have always made sure I am rooted/knowledged  in my culture. They have always told me that even if I am "American" society will see me as Korean. I hope that the love for Korea will spread and this is just the start of the American media industry accepting other countries.
